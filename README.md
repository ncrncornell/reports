# Annual Reports to NSF by the Cornell NCRN node

The NCRN-Cornell node conducts research into [Metadata Standards and Tools](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/projects#Metadata_Standards_and_Tools) and their application in the context of confidential data and metadata, [High-Dimensional Computational Statistics](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/projects#High-Dimensional_Computational_Statistics_with_Applications) and their applications in various contexts, and on the [Confidentiality and Privacy](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/projects#Confidentiality_and_Privacy) of data releases by private and public entities. We also teach about [Understanding Social and Economic Data](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/training/#Understanding_Social_and_Economic_Data) to a broad audience through videoconference and in the style of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), and we train graduate students and involve undergraduate researchers in our activities. We  publish scientific articles, create online codebooks for a variety of datasets that can be viewed [on a site that runs our own software](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/ced2ar-web/).

The NCRN-Cornell node is a part of the [NSF-Census Research Network (NCRN)](https://www.ncrn.info), a "_set of research nodes conducting interdisciplinary research and educational activities on methodological questions of interest and significance to the broader research community and to the Federal Statistical System, particularly the U.S. Bureau of the Census_" [source](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12017/nsf12017.jsp?org=SBE). Our activities are primarily funded by [NSF Grant SES-1131848](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1131848), with additional funding from a [Sloan Grant](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/6845). [Our staff](https://www.ncrn.cornell.edu/people/) come from the Cornell ILR Schoolâ€™s [Labor Dynamics Institute](http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/), the [Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research](http://ciser.cornell.edu/), the [School of Information at the University of Michigan](https://www.si.umich.edu/), and [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/).
