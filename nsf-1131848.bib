  abstract = {Social science researchers increasingly make use of data that is confidential
	because it contains linkages to the identities of people, corporations,
	etc. The value of this data lies in the ability to join the identifiable
	entities with external data such as genome data, geospatial information,
	and the like. However, the confidentiality of this data is a barrier
	to its utility and curation, making it difficult to fulfill US federal
	data management mandates and interfering with basic scholarly practices
	such as validation and reuse of existing results. We describe the
	complexity of the relationships among data that span a public and
	private divide. We then describe our work on the CED2AR prototype,
	a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans this
	divide and makes it possible for them to search, access, and cite
	that data.},

  abstract = {Provenance is a key component of evaluating the integrity and reusability
	of data for scholarship. While recording and providing access provenance
	has always been important, it is even more critical in the web environment
	in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can
	be combined and derived. The PROV model, developed under the auspices
	of the W3C, is a foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable,
	and web-compatible provenance metadata. We report on the results
	of our experimentation with integrating the PROV model into the DDI
	metadata for a complex, but characteristic, example social science
	data. We also present some preliminary thinking on how to visualize
	those graphs in the user interface.},

  title = {b-Bit Minwise Hashing in Practice},
  booktitle = {Internetware'13},
  year = {2013},
  month = {October},
  abstract = {Minwise hashing is a standard technique in the context of search for
	approximating set similarities. The recent work [26, 32] demonstrated
	a potential use of b-bit minwise hashing [23, 24] for efficient search
	and learning on massive, high-dimensional, binary data (which are
	typical for many applications in Web search and text mining). In
	this paper, we focus on a number of critical issues which must be
	addressed before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes
	of data often used industrial applications. Minwise hashing requires
	an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g., 500) minimal
	values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data
	vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed
	that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20 ~ 80
	and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. Reducing
	the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, e.g., for
	duplicate Web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step
	in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of
	online classifiers. Another critical issue is that for very large
	data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation
	matrix, due to its
	
	space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that
	b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g.,
	the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce
	very similar learning results as using fully random permutations.
	Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.},
