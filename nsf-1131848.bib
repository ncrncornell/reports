While recording and providing access provenance has always been important, it is even more critical in the web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived. The PROV model, developed under the auspices of the W3C, is a foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable, and web-compatible provenance metadata. We report on the results of our experimentation with integrating the PROV model into the DDI metadata for a complex, but characteristic, example social science data. We also present some preliminary thinking on how to visualize those graphs in the user interface.},

  Abstract                 = {Minwise hashing is a standard technique in the context of search for approximating set similarities. The recent work [26, 32] demonstrated a potential use of b-bit minwise hashing [23, 24] for efficient search and learning on massive, high-dimensional, binary data (which are typical for many applications in Web search and text mining). In this paper, we focus on a number of critical issues which must be addressed before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used industrial applications. Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20 ~ 80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. Reducing the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, e.g., for duplicate Web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of online classifiers. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its
space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.},
